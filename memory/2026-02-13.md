# 2026-02-13 - Cole Setup & Initial Automation

## Session Summary
Cole came online, we established identity (Clark the assistant), fixed critical config issues (404 errors), set up WhatsApp primary channel, built morning brief automation, and began Gmail integration work.

## Key Accomplishments
1. **Fixed 404 error cascade** — root cause identified: OPENCLAW_STARTER_PROXY_URL env var injected at gateway startup (longstanding issue)
2. **Switched to Haiku** — cost optimization per Cole's preference
3. **Connected WhatsApp** — primary channel established
4. **Scheduled morning brief** — 8 AM CT daily to WhatsApp, covers AI/energy/infrastructure themes + 31-ticker watchlist
5. **Configured Brave Search API** — enables news fetching for briefs
6. **First brief delivered** — Feb 13 at 14:57 UTC, full hyperscaler/semi/data center/energy coverage
7. **31-ticker watchlist saved** — organized by sector, ready for monitoring

## New Interests & Brainstorming Theme
- Cole's interest areas: deer hunting, archery, BJJ, exercise/health
- New project: business ideas around running from OpenClaw; focus on one area, generate revenue; daily iterations

## Gmail Setup Status
- Gmail onboarding in progress; we will use App Passwords or Gmail integration once resolved

## Next Actions
- Propose 3-5 business ideas within one of the interest areas
- Research feasibility, market size, pricing, and go-to-market ideas
- Establish a daily idea-review cadence
