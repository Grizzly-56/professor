# 2026-02-14 Session Notes

## Systems Check
- WhatsApp gateway connected and operational at 04:09 UTC
- API testing successful
- Cole reachable on +17135034555

## Active Projects Status

### 1. Morning Brief Automation
- **Status:** ✅ LIVE
- **Last run:** Feb 13 at 14:57 UTC
- **Delivery:** WhatsApp
- **Content:** 31-ticker watchlist + hyperscalers + semis + AI infra + energy
- **Requirement:** Brave Search API (configured)

### 2. Gmail Data Intake / Comp Table Framework  
- **Status:** 🔄 READY TO MOVE FORWARD
- **Blocker:** npm dependency install for IMAP poller script
- **Alternatives:** WhatsApp file upload (Excel/CSV/models) — simpler, Cole open to it
- **Decision pending:** Email vs WhatsApp for data flow

### 3. Professor — BJJ Move Logger App
- **Status:** ✅ BUILT, not yet committed
- **Built:** Feb 14 @ 03:04 UTC
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 + React 19
- **Features:**
  - Email/password login (local auth)
  - Log BJJ moves with notes
  - Auto-search tutorial videos via Brave API
  - Search/filter logged moves
  - Local storage persistence
- **API:** `/api/search-videos` — searches Brave for "[move] tutorial BJJ"
- **Next:** Run locally, test, iterate on features (dark mode, persistence, embeds, etc.)
- **Git:** Untracked (initialize and commit when ready)

## Brainstorming Session: Pain Points Research (14:22-15:46 UTC)

**Directive:** Research forums (Rokslide, Reddit) to uncover deeper pain points beyond surface-level solutions already existing

### BJJ Pain Points (from r/bjj)
1. **Injury Management** — 91% get injured; no app tracks injury patterns, recovery timelines, PT recommendations
2. **Information Overload** — Tons of tutorials online; no way to organize by position/skill/progression
3. **Gym Discovery** — Major complaint: gyms hide schedules/pricing; hard to plan training
4. **Training Partner Matching** — Size/skill mismatches; no platform to find compatible partners by weight/skill/location
5. **Competition Prep Structure** — Elite athletes do 8-week camps; most people don't know how to structure training
6. **Drilling Efficiency** — People want structured review intervals (1-3-9 day spaced repetition); no tracking tool exists
7. **Game Development** — "Creating a game is really difficult"; people want to log positions of strength + techniques that work

### Hunting Pain Points (from Rokslide forums)
1. **Trail Camera Triage** — "100 photos of trees for 1 deer pic"; auto-filter by deer/buck/coyote + flag new individuals is critical
2. **Stand Access Route Management** — "Deer know how you enter"; no tool tracks which routes are compromised
3. **Wind/Thermal Optimization** — Manual decision-making on stand placement based on wind + thermal flow
4. **Pressure Distribution** — Hunters overhunt same stands; need tool to track recent pressure + rest zones
5. **Food Plot ROI** — Soil tests, what plantings worked/failed, long-term records all manual spreadsheet tracking
6. **Stand Placement Decision Support** — Multiple variables (wind, bedding, food, access, pressure); currently guesswork
7. **Property Visualization** — No integrated map showing stands + plots + cameras + wind + deer patterns + access routes
8. **Other Hunter Pressure** — Gun season: UTVs everywhere; need to track where other hunters are hitting

### Opportunity Assessment
**Hunting (Higher ROI, More Immediate):**
- Deer camera AI triage (solve 1000-photo problem)
- Property mapping + stand optimizer (integrated layers)
- Access route tracker (which stands are still fresh)

**BJJ (Underserved):**
- Injury + recovery logger (PT tracking by move/position)
- Personal technique library (centralized video, review intervals)
- Training partner marketplace (match by skill/weight/location/schedule)
- Competition prep coach (8-week structured plans)

Cole's next focus: explore deeper, not surface-level. Will iterate on which direction to pursue.

## Known Issues
- Telegram: Persistent 404 errors (env vars baked into gateway startup) — WhatsApp is cleaner
